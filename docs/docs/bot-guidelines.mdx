# Bot Guidelines

### What You’re Not Allowed to Do on Your Bot Page:
When creating or editing your bot page, the following are strictly prohibited:
* Adding spam, irrelevant text, or random characters solely to meet the 200-character minimum requirement.
* Mentioning or including any NSFW (Not Safe For Work) content.
* Displaying media (images, GIFs, etc.) that could potentially trigger seizures.
* Using your bot page maliciously, including linking to harmful content.
* Advertising other competing platforms.
* Obstructing essential features like action buttons or platform advertisements.
* Misusing provided buttons to link to unrelated or misleading content.
* Listing an inaccurate or misleading command prefix.

### Bot Rules and Requirements:
To be listed and approved, your bot must meet the following criteria:
* Comply with Top.mezon.ai’s Terms of Service, Mezon’s Terms of Service, and Mezon Developer Guidelines.
* Be online, public, and invitable during the review process.
* Have a working core feature set.
* Contain any NSFW-related content strictly within NSFW-designated channels.
* Request only the permissions necessary for individual commands.
* Not be a direct clone or minimally modified fork of another bot.
* Provide a clear entry point, such as a working help command.
* Avoid using language that implies the sexualization of minors.
* Not impersonate another bot or developer with malicious intent.
* Not incentivize users to vote for a different bot.
* Limit vote-locked commands to a reasonable number (we recommend no more than 3–5).
* Ensure all owner-only commands are restricted to bot developers only.
* Include sender's name and an opt-out option for commands that allow DMing another user.
* Offer an unsubscribe option for voting reminders.
* Not rely on other bots in a way that disrupts their functionality.
* Not submit bots with very similar codebases as separate listings.
* Never request user login credentials (username, password, or tokens).
