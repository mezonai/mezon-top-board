Make sure you are logged in to your account to start the submission process! The “Add Bot” button can be found in the “My Profile” section:

After clicking on the “Add new bot” button, you will be navigated to the Add bot’s details page. You can provide information about your bot here, such as what it does, what commands it has, where users can find support, etc.

### Headline
Your headline also contributes to it showing up in search results. Keep it simple and catchy for best visibility!

### Full Description
The Full Description is your opportunity to provide in-depth information about your bot—what it does, how it works, and why someone should add it. If you’re unsure what to include, consider the following suggestions:
* List your main commands and highlight key features.
* Share a brief introduction, your bot’s purpose, and any future plans.
* Talk about your inspiration for building the bot and the problem it solves.
* Let users know how they can support your project.
You can also style your Description with different CSS styles.

### Prefix
The prefix is what triggers your bot to run a command. Example: if your bot responds to `*help`, then your prefix is `*`.

### Tag
You can assign tags to your bot to help it appear on relevant pages and improve its visibility.

### Install Link
The Install Link (Invite URL) field lets you provide a custom Mezon invite link for your bot, including any specific permissions or scopes it needs.
