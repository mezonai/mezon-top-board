# Common Questions regarding Submission and Reviewing Bots

### How long does the review process take?
Reviews typically take 1–3 business days, depending on the current queue. In some cases, it may take longer if additional verification is needed.

### Who reviews the submitted bots and apps?
Submissions are reviewed by the Mezon Top Board moderation team to ensure they meet quality, safety, and policy standards.

### How will I know if my bot is approved or rejected?
You’ll receive a notification on Mezon Top Board and/or via email once your bot has been reviewed.

### Can I see feedback or reasons for rejection?
Yes. If your bot is rejected, the reviewer will provide comments or a reason explaining what needs to be fixed.

### What should I do if my bot was rejected?
Review the rejection feedback carefully, make the necessary corrections, and then resubmit your bot for review.

### Can I contact the reviewer or request clarification on rejection feedback?
If the feedback is unclear, you can contact support through the Support page or through the team’s clan on Mezon.
